# Pee - Micro PHP Framework
Pee is a PHP micro framework.

  - Unopinionated.
  - Supports complex routing rules based on HTTP method and headers.
  - Interact with route end points fromm command line or run as HTTP server.

Overall aim was to create a minimal elegant web framework, and try not to do things you can't easily do your self, better. Basically it's a router plus some convenience stuff for logging and dealing with app configuration consistently.

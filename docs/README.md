# Pee - Micro PHP Framework
Pee is a PHP micro framework. Works good for simplish sites. Overall aim was to create a minimal elegant web framework, with generally good software qualities, and try not to do things you can't easily do your self, better. Basically it's a router plus some convenience stuff for doing app logging and dealing with app configuration consistently.
